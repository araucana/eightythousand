TODO

* Format results (<1 hour of work, this was just deprioritized)
* Manual testing
* more elegant alert pop up for when a user hasn't submitted scores
* Higher score counts (to make sure feel happier)
* Look into ngchange problem and make sure ngclick bugfix works on mobile / keyboard shortcuts
* hook in angular sanitize library so I can print proper HTML instead of sanitized HTML
* Import fonts
